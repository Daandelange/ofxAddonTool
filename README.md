ofxAddonTool
============
![ofxAddonTool](./ofxaddons_thumbnail.png)  
A simple standalone bash script for managing your OpenFrameworks addon dependencies using git and a project-specific configuration file.  
![ofxAddonTool Screenshot](./ofxAddonTool_screenshot.png)  

Introduction
------------
Working with several OpenFrameworks projects, each requiring specific versions of ofxAddons can be a headache. This script aims to simplify dependency installation, verification and updating.  

### How it works
It compares a configuration file (`addons.txt`) against the `openframeworks/addons` folder then runs some diagnostic checks and actions on them.

Current State
-------------
This tool is still under development (alpha). Basic functionality is there and remains to be tested on a wider set of configurations.  
Any [feedback, suggestions or contributions](https://github.com/Daandelange/ofxAddonTool/issues) are welcome.

Installation
------------
To install this tool, the easiest way is to add it to your OpenFrameworks project **as a submodule**, so you can easily track updates.  
You're free to install it in the root of your project or in any subfolder. The script will assume your project root is the first parent directory containing `addons.txt`.  
*Please, note that this is not an OpenFrameworks addon, so don't install it in `path/to/of/addons`.*  


In the example below, we will install it to the `scripts` folder.
````bash
cd /path/to/of/apps/myApps/exampleApp
mkdir scripts && cd ./scripts
git submodule add https://github.com/Daandelange/ofxAddonTool.git
mv ./scipts/ofxAddonTool/addons.txt ./addons.txt
````

**Alternatively**, you can also download [`ofxAddonTool.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daandelange/ofxAddonTool/master/ofxAddonTool.sh) + [`addons.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daandelange/ofxAddonTool/master/addons.txt) and place them in the root of your project directory.  
````bash
cd /path/to/of/apps/myApps/exampleApp
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daandelange/ofxAddonTool/master/addons.txt -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daandelange/ofxAddonTool/master/ofxAddonTool.sh
````

### Install required dependencies
For the use of `realpath`, included in the GNU core utilities :
- Mac : `brew install coreutils` or `brew install coreutils --build-from-source` (10.12)
- Linux : Included in most distros.

### Install optional dependencies
If you want fancy ASCI art, install `toilet` or `figlet`. (optional)
- Mac : `brew install figlet`
- Linux : `apt install figlet`

Configuration
-----
Edit `yourProject/addons.txt` with your favourite text editor to suit the needs of your project.    
For each addon, you need to provide the title (folder name), the URL and the branch to checkout.  
Further instructions are within that file.  

Usage
-----
````bash
cd /path/to/of/apps/myApps/exampleApp/scripts/ofxAddonTool
./ofxAddonTool.sh --check
./ofxAddonTool.sh --help
````

Updating
--------
To get the latest version of this script.
````bash
# Get updates
cd /path/to/of/apps/myApps/exampleApp/scripts/ofxAddonTool
git checkout master && git pull

# Tell your project to use ofxAddonTool's latest commit (repo owners only)
cd /path/to/of/apps/myApps/exampleApp
git add /scripts/ofxAddonTool
git commit -m "Update submodule ofxAddonTool to latest version."
git push

# Synchronize all submodules of your project (user update method)
cd /path/to/of/apps/myApps/exampleApp
git checkout master && git pull
git submodule update
````

Compatibility
-------------
This script is coded in pure Bash script. It runs on Linux and Mac. Windows is untested but should work.  
An internet connection is recommended to get the latest remote updates from your git remotes.  
*Note: This script could easily be adapted as a git addon manager, without anything OpenFrameworks.*


Version history
---------------
See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).


Alternative
-----------
[ofPackageManager](https://github.com/thomasgeissl/ofPackageManager) is a more extended oF package manager which installs as a system-wide tool.  
Compared to it, ofxAddonTool is a lightweight plug'n'play solution, but it doesn't offer as much features.  
*(Note: Their configuration files are not compatible [yet?])*
